# Whats gezel?
According to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gezel/>Wikipedia</a>
Gezel is a hardware description language, allowing the implementation of a Finite State Machine + Datapath (FSMD) model.
Since running a gezel code is a little tricky, I decided to guide you for the installtion...

# OS
As our sources are .deb this should work for every debian based linux
by the way I used <a href=https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04/>ubuntu Jammy Jellyfish</a>
and it worked pretty well.

# Installtion process
clone this repository
```
    git
```
